Keywords Test	- info -	There is likely no optimal keyword density (search engine algorithms have evolved beyond keyword density metrics as a significant ranking factor). It can be useful, however, to note which keywords appear most often in your page, and if they reflect the intended topic of your page. More importantly, the keywords in your page should appear within natural sounding and grammatically correct copy.
